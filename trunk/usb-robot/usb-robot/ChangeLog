	* configure.in: correctly mark readline.h as optional - problem
	spotted by Glenn Ramsey <glennr@es.co.nz>.

2001-02-23  John Fremlin  <chief@bandits.org>

	* control.c (ub_getline): Implement a getline so things work on
	FreeBSD.

	* README: say FreeBSD is supported

	* Makefile.am: use rm -f instead of $(RM) which is not portable

	* control.c (command_transfer): returning 0 from usb_control_msg
	is not an error, thanks to Anthony Rumble
	<arumble@users.sourceforge.net> for pointing this out.

	* NEWS: Version 0.2.0

	* INSTALL: detail requirements more explicitly

	* Makefile.am: no need to add libusb explicitly

	* configure.in: readline support and libusb detection

	* control.c (ub_getline): readline support!

	* output.c (usb_error): Now use libusb-0.1.3b usb_strerror.

	* main.c (main,scan_bus,open_device): Change bus and device
	identification printing to pathnames, for libusb-0.1.3b
